NOTE: App is not working correctly on heroku, but works correctly from localhost:3002, not sure why.

## Description 

We put together this fitness tracker to show our knowledge in using MongoDB, and expressjs. This app was created to help people log their workouts so they are able to see how much they have done in a week. 

We were given front-end starter code and had to build the backend with mongo.

## Installation
For this app, you can use the heroku link.

You could also open it in VSCode, simply npm i, start mongod, then npm start and run the app on localhost:3002.
